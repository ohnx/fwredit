# options for AVR vm

* avrvm, compile with emscripten
   * seems buggier and doesn't seem to like running my code
* avr-vm (https://github.com/MackieLoeffel/avr-vm/blob/master/src/cpu.rs),
  compile with https://kripken.github.io/blog/binaryen/2018/04/18/rust-emscripten.html
   * seems more complete
   * this is also a disadvantage though since it might not be easily
     customizeable to my needs
   * rust (which I don't really know)
